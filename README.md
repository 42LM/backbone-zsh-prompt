# ü¶¥ BackBone zsh prompt
BackBone is a prompt with the bare minimum needed for a working zsh prompt that tracks git changes.  
BB[^1] is ~a blazingly fast~ the roadrunner of the prompts! Be prepared for some [Meep! Meep! Moments](https://youtu.be/Hd2JgADY9d8).

I was in need of a super simple minimal prompt that fulfills my needs:
* fast
* easy setup
* single file
* git support
* minimal features

... furthermore i ended up building this one.

If you are like me and just looking for a prompt that is _"not more than the bare minimum needed"_  
**-- Stop looking!**

üöß Please keep in mind: While this prompt is already battle tested it is still work in progress üöß

## Install
Load the prompt in your `.zshrc` file:

```zsh
# only load prompt if the `prompt.zsh` file exists
[ -f $HOME/path-to-bb-folder/backbone-zsh-prompt/prompt.zsh ] && \
source $HOME/path-to-bb-folder/backbone-zsh-prompt/prompt.zsh
```
