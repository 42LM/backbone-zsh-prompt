<p align="center">A bare minimum single file prompt, fast as a roadrunner MEEP! MEEP! üí® ...</p>

<br><br>

BackBone is a prompt with the bare minimum needed for a working zsh prompt that tracks git changes.  
BB[^1] is ~a blazingly fast~ the roadrunner of the prompts! Be prepared for some [Meep! Meep! Moments](https://youtu.be/Hd2JgADY9d8).

I was in need of a super simple minimal prompt that fulfills my needs. It has to be fast, easy to setup, a single file and have git support with minimal features. Furthermore i ended up building this one.

If you are like me and just looking for a prompt that is _"not more than the bare minimum needed"_  
**-- Stop looking!**

üöß Please keep in mind: While this prompt is already battle tested it is still work in progress üöß
